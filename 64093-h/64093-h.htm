<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Says</span> the watchman, “And what of the night?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It often brings seasons of sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dark and beclouded with sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But ah! it may sweeten to-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a ray of God’s favor breaks in.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How dark and how gloomy was Chaos;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God by his own matchless plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Call’d this beautiful world from its darkness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did safe on its axle-tree hang!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Jesus, our Savior, was present,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his was the word of command;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spangled those orbs in their greatness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For good and for glory to man.”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The angels in wonder stood gazing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Sol darts his beams to their view;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“What is there in the East that is blazing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pearls all the drops of the dew?”<br /></span>
<span class="i2">“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis the Sun,” Great Messiah then answered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“<span class="lftspc">’</span>Tis the Sun,” say the angels, “<span class="lftspc">’</span>tis true;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From thee it beams glory and greatness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bears up thy own title too.”<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great Sol, arise! and spread thy lustre high&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go warm the earth, and decorate the sky!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou retir’st, the silver moon will rise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pearly radiance, o’er those spangled skies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a cloud to intercept thy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, clearly shine, and make the evening gay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God saw his work was great, when it he view’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approved the same, and then pronounced it good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why this garden, walled so rich and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glittering stone that is beyond compare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With walks, and bowers, and interwoven scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With silver rivulets that roll between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossing their golden pebbles in the stream!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here richest fruits, in clusters ripe and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And variegated blooms perfume the air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here beast of every kind, playful yet mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And birds with plumage gay, and warbling throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanting to their Maker with melodious note!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is the richness of these fruits conceal’d,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grow spontaneous in this fertile field?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is no one here these sweets to taste? And none the banquet share?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within these walls is a majestic form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Graceful and noble as the rising morn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adam! survey thy wond’rous form, and see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The image of thy God is stamped on thee!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be grateful, then, and be obedient, too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this respect is to thy Sov’reign due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here are richest fruits in store for thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all is thine, except that hallow’d tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should’st thou touch it, thou shall surely die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have pronounced! Ask not the reason why.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Adam bows assent, and walks the rounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the beauties of these fertile grounds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stops to listen to the bubbling stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gently trickles down the sloping green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his way he views the crystal pond<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Where gold-fish play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delighted with the scene, he looks above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adores the greatness of the God of Love.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But day is done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the western hills now sinks the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adam with wonder views the evening scene&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first fair twilight he had ever seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now with drowsy sleep his eyes are pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For God has sanctioned all creation rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Christian attitude kneels to the shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offers up his prayers in words divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to his mossy pillow Adam goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought to disturb or break his soft repose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sleeps secure till morning light appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And birds of Paradise salute his ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then o’er some loaded bough his arm he’s flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addressed his Maker with his morning song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the willow’d meads he did repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view his flocks, and see them gambol there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scrutiny, he sees each has a friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own bosom he thus contends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why am I exempt, my mind is good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I’ve a speech well to be understood&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here’s my Sov’reign.” “Adam, answer! why<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That downcast look&mdash;that soft, expressive sigh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not a Paradise for thee suffice?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Great Sov’reign! oft I stand in ecstacy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Viewing the greatness of thy Deity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know thy works are infinite, supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And canst answer every wished for scheme.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Adam! I see thy faith is strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak thy request, nor hesitate too long.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A friend, a partner give to sweeten life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then these rural scenes are Paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Adam, sleep! and to thee I’ll give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A form for whom thou’lt ever wish to live.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from his side the ivory bone he takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beauteous woman of the same he makes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But O! our hearts are bent on pleasure here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The disappointment oft times is severe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Adam wanders forth we know not where,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves alone the unprotected fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fiend, on search, the separation knew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“This is my time, and I’ll improve it, too:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, beauteous Eve, hast thou no greater mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to these simple flowers to be confined?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take this delicious fruit, and then you’ll see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That greater glories are in store for thee.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“That is forbidden fruit; O no! not I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if I eat, then I must surely die.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Misrepresented is the fruit I give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I eat the same, and yet you see I live.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her innocence had never known a lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So to his treacherous art she did comply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took the apple! When she ate the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poisonous juice had tainted every vein.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But Adam comes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Say, lovely Eve, where is thy beauty fled?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is the bloom that tinged thy cheek with red?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who has been here?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“A treacherous friend! and I believed his lie:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ate the apple&mdash;I alone must die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some remotest corner let me be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And die alone, dear friend, unseen by thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear Adam, do not grieve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps thy God will grant another Eve.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“No other Eve shall e’er entwine this heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bone of my bone, from thee I cannot part.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ate the apple, while all nature grieved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every leaf became a sensitive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh, the black’ning cloud to heaven arose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the horror of their sins exposed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was silent till God’s holy Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Array’d in glory, to his Father came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Father of mercies! let thy will be done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, cast the sinner’s burden on thy Son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I alone their advocate will be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their redemption will be found through me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when this world is peopled o’er with men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Satan will resume his power again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So blind their eyes, and cause their hearts to sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will be mortal&mdash;I will dwell with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast this monster to his lowest den.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For on the cross sinners will raise me high:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their redemption willingly I die.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what does God require for sins like this?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Believe and live, and Christ secures the bliss.<br /></span>

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
